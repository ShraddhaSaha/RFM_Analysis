Customer Segmentation using RFM

Situation: Business needed to identify high-value, at-risk, and new customers to improve targeting.

Task: Build an RFM model using SQL to segment customers based on purchase behavior.

Action: Cleaned and merged transactional datasets; calculated Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics; applied NTILE scoring; created RFM segments through SQL window functions.

Result: Segmented 100+ customers into actionable groups (Champions, Loyal, Big Spenders, At-Risk, Lost), enabling data-driven marketing decisions.
